# ruby-sdk-core
This project contains the core functionality used by Ruby SDK's generated by the
[IBM OpenAPI SDK Generator](https://github.ibm.com/CloudEngineering/openapi-sdkgen).
Ruby code generated by openapi-sdkgen will depend on the function contained in this project.

## Installation

Install the gem:

```bash
gem install ibm_cloud_sdk_core
```

Inside of your Ruby program do:

```ruby
require "ibm_cloud_sdk_core"
```

## Authentication Types
There are several flavors of authentication supported in this package. To specify the intended authentication pattern to use, the user can pass in the parameter `authentication_type`. This parameter is optional, but it may become required in a future major release. The options for this parameter are `basic`, `iam`, `bearer_token`  and `cp4d`.

### basic
This indicates Basic Auth is to be used. Users will pass in a `username` and `password` and the SDK will generate a Basic Auth header to send with requests to the service.

## bearer token
This indicates that bearer token authentication is to be used. Users can pass in an `bearer_token`, and SDK will generate a Bearer Auth header to send with requests to the service.

### iam
This indicates that IAM token authentication is to be used. Users can pass in an `apikey`. The SDK will manage the token for the user and it will generate a Bearer Auth header to send with requests to the service.

### cp4d
This indicates that the service is an instance of ICP4D, which has its own version of token authentication. Users can pass in a `username` and `password`. If a username and password is given, the SDK will manage the token for the user.
A `cp4d_url` is **required** for this type. In order to use an SDK-managed token with ICP4D authentication, this option **must** be passed in.
